# vf2-torvalds-kernel-config
a minimal .config to build Linus' kernel on and for VisionFive2

I will update this on each RC, always saying "NO" to any new setting that is not relevant to the VF2.  Once a kernel version gets released, I will do a final build and from there create a new config file for the next version's first RC.
